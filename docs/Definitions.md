## Core System Concepts

- **RumbleDome** â€“ A torque-aware electronic boost controller that cooperates with modern ECU torque management systems rather than fighting them. Implements intelligent torque-following control using a single aggression parameter.

- **Torque Request Amplifier** â€“ RumbleDome's fundamental approach: amplifying ECU torque requests rather than following predetermined boost curves. Works in harmony with ECU logic by helping it achieve torque goals faster or slower based on user preference.

- **3-Tier Priority Hierarchy** â€“ RumbleDome's organizing control philosophy:
  - **Priority 1**: "Don't Kill My Car" (overboost protection, always overrides)
  - **Priority 2**: Performance (forceful max boost targeting)  
  - **Priority 3**: Comfort (smooth gentle operation)
  - **Aggression Setting**: Determines whether Priority 2 or 3 leads

- **Torque-Following Control** â€“ Primary control strategy using ECU torque signals rather than traditional pressure-based control. Uses `(desired_torque - actual_torque)` from CAN bus to determine boost assistance.

- **ECU Cooperation** â€“ The strategy of working with the ECU's torque management rather than fighting it. Maintains ECU driver demand table validity by providing predictable boost response.

## User Interface & Control

- **Aggression** â€“ Single user control parameter (0.0-1.0) that scales all torque-following response characteristics:
  - **0.0 (Puppy Dog)**: System OFF, naturally aspirated feel
  - **0.5 (Daily Driver)**: Balanced torque assistance  
  - **1.0 (Brimstone)**: Maximum ECU torque request assistance

- **Scramble Button** â€“ Momentary override button providing instant 100% aggression regardless of current setting. Returns to normal aggression when released.

- **6-Parameter Configuration** â€“ Simplified user setup requiring only:
  - `aggression` (0.0-1.0): Torque-following aggressiveness
  - `spring_pressure` (PSI): Wastegate spring pressure
  - `max_boost_psi` (PSI): Operational target ceiling for boost pressure
  - `overboost_limit` (PSI): Hard safety fault threshold  
  - `scramble_enabled` (bool): Enable scramble button functionality
  - `cold_engine_protection` (bool): Enable temperature-based aggression limiting

- **User Responsibility Model** â€“ Design philosophy where users set safety limits and the system provides intelligent guidance, never enforcement beyond overboost protection.

## Learning System

- **Learned Data** â€“ System knowledge acquired through operation, stored separately from user configuration. Four categories:
  - **Duty Cycle Calibration**: Core boost control learning
  - **Environmental Compensation**: Temperature/altitude/pressure adaptation
  - **Sensor Fusion Cross-Calibration**: CAN MAP vs boost gauge offset learning
  - **Safety Response Parameters**: Optimal overboost recovery characteristics

- **STFT/LTFT Learning** â€“ Fast and slow learning adaptation similar to ECU fuel trims:
  - **STFT (Short-Term)**: Fast adaptation to immediate conditions (5% per cycle)
  - **LTFT (Long-Term)**: Slow adaptation to long-term trends (0.1% per cycle)

- **Progressive Calibration** â€“ Learning approach starting at conservative limits (spring+1 PSI), gradually expanding as system proves safety response capability.

- **Multi-Pass Validation** â€“ Requirement for consistent results across multiple calibration runs before accepting learned values.

- **Learning Confidence** â€“ Metric (0.0-1.0) tracking quality and reliability of learned parameters.

## Storage Architecture

- **SD Card Storage** â€“ Primary storage system using FAT32 filesystem for all configuration and learned data. Provides unlimited capacity and excellent development workflow.

- **Debounced Persistence** â€“ Write optimization strategy delaying storage writes 5-10 seconds after changes to minimize SD card wear during adjustment sessions.

- **Atomic Operations** â€“ Crash-safe file operations using temporary files and atomic renames to prevent corruption from power loss.

- **File Structure** â€“ Organized storage layout:
  ```
  /config/user_config.json      (6-parameter user configuration)
  /learned/[category].json       (learned data by category)
  /backups/[timestamp]/          (automatic rolling backups)
  /logs/[date]/                  (diagnostic and safety logs)
  ```

- **Separation Strategy** â€“ User configuration and learned data stored in separate files, enabling independent reset and backup operations.

## Safety Systems

- **Max Boost Limit (PSI)** â€“ Target operational ceiling for boost pressure during normal operation. System should avoid exceeding this level but brief overshoots are not dangerous to the engine. Part of normal configuration parameters.

- **Overboost Limit (PSI)** â€“ Hard safety ceiling beyond which engine damage may occur. Any pressure above this level triggers immediate emergency response (0% duty cycle). Must be set higher than Max Boost Limit.

- **Safety Margin** â€“ The gap between Max Boost Limit and Overboost Limit, providing protection against dangerous pressure levels while allowing operational flexibility.

- **Overboost vs Max Boost** â€“ Critical distinction:
  - **Max Boost**: Operational target limit - avoid exceeding but brief spikes acceptable
  - **Overboost**: Hard safety fault threshold - immediate emergency response required

- **Defense in Depth** â€“ Multiple independent safety layers:
  - **Electronic**: Software monitoring and response
  - **Pneumatic**: Physical system failsafe design
  - **Mechanical**: Spring-loaded wastegate backup

- **Fail-Safe Operation** â€“ System design ensuring any failure results in safest state: 0% duty â†’ lower dome pressurized â†’ wastegate open â†’ minimal boost.

- **Progressive Overboost Limits** â€“ Safety approach increasing overboost limits only as system proves adequate safety response capability.

- **Learned Safety Parameters** â€“ System learns optimal overboost recovery characteristics (hysteresis, timing) rather than using fixed user-configured values.

  - **Upper Dome**: Wastegate closing force monitoring

## Control Algorithms
