# RumbleDome Safety Requirements

üìñ **For terminology**: See **[Definitions.md](Definitions.md)** for safety-related concepts and technical terms

## üèóÔ∏è Tier 1: Foundational Safety Philosophy

### Critical Safety Principles

**üîó T1-SAFETY-002**: **Defense in Depth Strategy**  
**Decision Type**: üéØ **Core Safety Architecture**  
**Creative Rationale**: Multiple independent safety layers prevent single-point-of-failure catastrophic engine damage  
**AI Traceability**: Drives all safety implementations (SY-1 through SY-24), redundant monitoring systems

RumbleDome employs multiple independent safety layers to prevent engine damage under all failure scenarios:

1. **Electronic Safety**: Software-based monitoring and response
2. **Pneumatic Safety**: Physical system design ensures safe failure modes
3. **Mechanical Safety**: Spring-loaded wastegate provides final backup

**üîó T1-SAFETY-003**: **Fail-Safe Design Philosophy**  
**Decision Type**: üéØ **Fundamental Safety Principle**  
**Creative Rationale**: Any failure mode must bias toward naturally aspirated operation, never toward higher boost  
**AI Traceability**: Drives all fault handling logic, failure mode analysis, system recovery procedures

**Primary Principle**: Any system failure must result in the safest possible state - minimal boost operation.

## Control Philosophy Safety Integration  

### **Safety-Integrated Control Hierarchy**
RumbleDome's safety approach directly implements the established control philosophy:

**Priority 1: "Don't Kill My Car"** - Overboost prevention with maximum authority (always overrides)
**Priority 2 & 3: Performance ‚öñÔ∏è Comfort Balance** - Aggression determines which leads:
- **High Aggression**: Performance leads (forceful max boost targeting)
- **Low Aggression**: Comfort leads (smooth gentle operation) 
- **Brief spikes above max boost acceptable** - sustained elevation triggers learning

### **Overboost vs Max Boost Distinction**
- **Overboost (`overboost_limit`)**: Fault condition requiring immediate hard correction (duty=0%) and learning updates
- **Max Boost Spikes (`max_boost_psi`)**: Brief transient spikes above this safety ceiling are acceptable during normal operation
- **Tolerance Policy**: System focuses authority on preventing overboost faults, not perfect max boost adherence

## üèóÔ∏è Tier 2: Derived Safety Requirements

**All SY-* specifications below are üîó Direct Derivations from Tier 1 safety philosophy above**

## Non-Negotiable Safety Invariants

### SY-1: Pneumatic Fail-Safe Operation

**üîó T2-SAFETY-001**: **Zero-Duty Fail-Safe**  
**Derived From**: T1-SAFETY-003 (Fail-Safe Design Philosophy)  
**Decision Type**: üîó **Direct Derivation** - Physical implementation of fail-safe principle  
**AI Traceability**: Drives pneumatic system design, solenoid control algorithms, fault detection logic

- **Requirement**: `duty = 0%` forces full input pressure to lower dome ‚Üí wastegate forced open ‚Üí minimal boost
- **Rationale**: Physical system design ensures that total electronic failure results in safe operation
- **Validation**: System behavior must be verified through pneumatic testing with solenoid power removed

### SY-2: High-Authority System Recognition

**üîó T2-SAFETY-002**: **High-Authority Recognition**  
**Derived From**: T1-SAFETY-002 (Defense in Depth Strategy)  
**Decision Type**: üîó **Direct Derivation** - Conservative control strategy from defense principle  
**AI Traceability**: Drives control algorithm sensitivity limits, duty cycle rate limiting, gain scheduling

- **Requirement**: System recognizes that small duty cycle changes can produce large boost changes, requiring more conservative control strategies
- **Rationale**: High-pressure pneumatic system can achieve dangerous boost levels with relatively low duty cycles (15-20%)
- **Implementation**: All control algorithms must account for high system sensitivity

### SY-3: Overboost Response Validation
- **Requirement**: System must verify it can dump upper dome pressure fast enough before allowing higher input pressures
- **Rationale**: High input pressures may prevent adequate overboost response time
- **Testing**: Automated overboost response time validation during system startup and configuration changes

### SY-4: Progressive Calibration Safety
- **Requirement**: Auto-calibration starts at spring+1 psi overboost limits, increases only as system proves safety response
- **Rationale**: Learning system must never exceed proven safe operating limits
- **Implementation**: Calibration system maintains conservative limits until multi-pass validation confirms safe operation

## Configuration & Control Safety

### SY-5: No Raw Duty Cycle Configuration
- **Requirement**: All user-facing configuration is in PSI/kPa; system learns required duty cycles through calibration
- **Rationale**: Prevents user misconfiguration that could result in dangerous duty cycles
- **Enforcement**: User interface must not accept or display raw duty cycle values

### SY-6: Torque Ceiling Enforcement
- **Requirement**: CAN torque error drives control loop; pressure limits provide safety override
- **Rationale**: ECU cooperation prevents harsh interventions while maintaining ultimate safety control
- **Override Logic**: Manifold pressure limits always take precedence over torque-based control requests

### SY-7: Configurable Spring Pressure
- **Requirement**: Wastegate spring pressure must be user-configurable, not hardcoded
- **Rationale**: Different installations have different spring pressures; system must adapt to actual hardware
- **Validation**: Spring pressure setting must be validated against actual system response

### SY-8: Pneumatic System Optimization
- **Requirement**: System recommends optimal input air pressure for control resolution and safety response
- **Rationale**: Prevents dangerous configurations where overboost response time is inadequate
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of pneumatic system health and response capability

## Fault Handling & Recovery

### SY-9: Critical Fault Response
- **Requirement**: Any sensor/CAN/NVM fault ‚áí duty=0%, visible fault reason, logged timestamp
- **Implementation**: All fault conditions must be detectable within 200ms and result in immediate safe state
- **Recovery**: Manual fault acknowledgment required before system can resume operation

### SY-10: CAN Dependency Management
- **Requirement**: Lost CAN torque signals = fault condition (no fallback to pressure-only mode)
- **Rationale**: System is designed around ECU cooperation; operating without ECU data compromises safety model
- **Timeout**: CAN signal loss detection within 500ms maximum

### SY-11: Learning System Bounds
- **Requirement**: All learned duty cycle adjustments have slew rate limits (maximum change per time period) and absolute bounds (cannot exceed proven safe ranges), and are stored separately from user configuration
- **Rationale**: Prevents learning system from making dangerous adjustments
- **Limits**: Learning adjustments limited to ¬±5% per hour maximum, ¬±20% absolute maximum from baseline

### SY-12: Learning Reset Capability
- **Requirement**: Provide command to reset all learned calibration data
- **Rationale**: Enables recovery from corrupted or dangerous learned parameters
- **Preservation**: Reset operation preserves user configuration parameters

## Development & Validation Safety

### SY-13: Core Logic Portability
- **Requirement**: Control logic compiles/runs on desktop without MCU dependencies
- **Rationale**: Enables comprehensive testing of safety-critical algorithms without hardware
- **Coverage**: All safety logic must be testable through desktop simulation

### SY-14: Comprehensive Safety Testing
- **Requirement**: All safety behaviors covered by unit/integration tests; CI must pass before merge
- **Coverage Targets**: 
  - 100% coverage of fault handling paths
  - 100% coverage of overboost response scenarios
  - 100% coverage of learning bounds enforcement
- **Validation**: Automated testing of safety response timing requirements

### SY-15: Progressive Validation Requirements
- **Requirement**: Each calibration phase requires successful completion before advancing to higher boost limits
- **Criteria**: Multi-pass consistency, overboost response validation, system health confirmation
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback to previous safe limits if validation fails

## Safety Monitoring & Diagnostics

### SY-16: Real-Time Safety Monitoring
- **Overboost Detection**: Continuous monitoring with <100ms response time
- **Sensor Validation**: Plausibility checking of all pressure sensor readings
- **CAN Signal Validation**: Torque signal range and consistency checking
- **System Health**: Pneumatic response time validation and performance monitoring

### SY-17: Safety Event Logging
- **Requirement**: All safety events logged with precise timestamps and system state
- **Retention**: Safety logs preserved across power cycles
- **Analysis**: Logged data sufficient for post-incident analysis and system improvement

### SY-18: Operator Safety Feedback
- **Immediate Feedback**: All safety interventions immediately visible on display
- **System Status**: Continuous indication of safety system health and readiness
- **Warnings**: Proactive warnings for conditions that could compromise safety

## Environmental & Operational Safety

### SY-19: Supply Pressure Safety Monitoring
- **Requirement**: Feed pressure monitoring with fault detection to ensure pneumatic control authority
- **Low Pressure Fault**: Feed pressure below `Spring Pressure + Safety Margin` compromises wastegate opening authority for overboost protection
- **High Pressure Fault**: Excessive feed pressure compresses solenoid control range, reducing precision for proper wastegate control  
- **Learning Compensation Bounds**: Feed pressure variation compensation must maintain minimum control authority and not exceed maximum pressure ratings
- **Implementation**: See Architecture.md T2-CONTROL-009 for feed pressure monitoring and fault detection algorithms

### SY-20: Operational State Safety
- **Power-On Safety**: System starts in safe state, requires explicit activation
- **Control Knob Changes**: Live control knob changes validated for safety before activation
- **Calibration Safety**: Calibration mode has additional safety constraints and monitoring
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Manual emergency shutdown capability always available

## Safety Validation Requirements

- **SY-24.2**: User warnings displayed for SD card errors  
- **SY-24.3**: SD card failure triggers fault state requiring user intervention
- **SY-24.4**: All writes use atomic operations (temp file + rename) to prevent corruption
- **SY-24.5**: Learning system uses debounced writes to minimize SD card wear
