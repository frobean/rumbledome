## 🎯 Why This Tool Exists

### The Problem: Vibe Coding at Scale

**Traditional development approach:**
```
Developer: "I need boost control"
AI: "Here's some boost control code" 
*generates plausible-looking but potentially dangerous code*
Result: Technical debt, safety issues, unmaintainable systems
```

### The Solution: Systematic Engineering Made Easy

**RumbleDome approach:**
```
Developer: "I need boost control"  
Tool: "Found existing T2-CONTROL-003 boost control specification"
      "Or generate new T2-CONTROL-009 with derivation template"
AI: "Implementing T2-CONTROL-003 exactly as specified..."
Result: Traceable, safe, maintainable implementation
```

### 🔗 The Force Multiplier Effect
