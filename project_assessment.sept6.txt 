  Core Innovation Analysis

  üéØ The Fundamental Departure

  Traditional EBC Philosophy:
  - "More boost = more power" (pressure-centric thinking)
  - Fight against ECU logic with predetermined curves
  - Focus on maximum boost capability

  RumbleDome Philosophy:
  - "Amplify ECU torque requests" (torque-centric thinking)
  - Cooperate with ECU by monitoring torque gap
  - Focus on precise torque assistance when needed

  üî¨ Physics Foundation - Exceptional Depth

  Turbocharger System Physics:
  - Complete energy flow analysis from combustion ‚Üí exhaust ‚Üí turbine ‚Üí compressor ‚Üí boost
  - Force balance equations for wastegate positioning with mathematical precision
  - 4-sensor monitoring enables real-time physics validation
  - Pneumatic dynamics modeling accounts for finite response rates

  Key Technical Insights:
  1. Energy recycling loop understanding drives control strategy
  2. Force balance equation enables precise wastegate positioning
  3. Rate limiting analysis prevents control instability
  4. Hardware constraints (no position feedback) properly acknowledged

  Control System Architecture Analysis

  üèóÔ∏è 3-Tier Priority Hierarchy - Brilliant Design

  Priority 1: "Don't Kill My Car" üö®
  - Hard overboost protection with maximum authority
  - Always overrides - no exceptions for performance

  Priority 2 & 3: Performance ‚öñÔ∏è Comfort Balance
  - Aggression knob mediates between competing priorities
  - High aggression ‚Üí Performance leads (Priority 2)

  Technical Elegance: Single control balances safety, performance, comfort without compromise

  üîÑ ECU Integration Strategy - Novel Approach

  Torque-Following Control:
  ECU desired_torque ‚Üí Control algorithm ‚Üí Boost assistance ‚Üí ECU actual_torque

  Integration Points:
