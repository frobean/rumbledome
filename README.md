# RumbleDome â€” Meta Docs (Baseline)

This bundle contains the **baseline, non-placeholder** documents we agreed to keep as the source of truth.

- See `/docs/Context.md` for the full project context/spec.
- See `/docs/MustNotDrop.md` for invariants we never regress.
- See `/docs/ImplementationSpec.md` and `/docs/Interfaces.md` for module boundaries & APIs.
- See `/docs/CalibrationAndDefaults.md` for initial values.
- See `/docs/TestPlan.md` for unit/integration/HIL coverage.
- See `/docs/CAN_Signals.md` for *SPECULATIVE* Gen2 Coyote CAN notes to be replaced by verified signals.
