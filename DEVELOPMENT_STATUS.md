## PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION REMOVED üóëÔ∏è
The entire previous codebase was removed on 2024-09-02 due to significant design evolution. Key changes that necessitated fresh start:

### Design Philosophy Changes
- **Torque-following approach**: System now follows ECU torque requests, not predetermined boost curves
- **Aggression-based control**: Single aggression parameter (0.0-1.0) replaces complex profile system  
- **3-tier priority hierarchy**: Safety ‚Üí Performance/Comfort balance based on aggression level
- **ECU cooperation**: Work with ECU logic instead of fighting it
- **User responsibility model**: Users set limits, system provides intelligent guidance

### Architecture Refinements  
- **5-parameter configuration**: Simplified from complex profile system
- **Safety ceiling vs targets**: max_boost_psi is safety limit, not operational target
- **Consistent terminology**: Eliminated control_knob confusion, pure aggression semantics

## Phase 4: Hardware Integration üìã FUTURE
- [ ] Fresh HAL implementation aligned with TechnicalSpecs.md
- [ ] Real hardware bring-up and pin assignment validation  
- [ ] CAN signal verification with actual Ford Gen2 Coyote vehicle
- [ ] Pressure sensor calibration with real sensors

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation üìã FUTURE
- [ ] Unit test framework for new architecture
- [ ] Integration tests for torque-following control loops
- [ ] Safety system validation per Safety.md requirements
- [ ] Hardware-in-loop validation setup
- [ ] Real vehicle integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Phase 6: Enhanced Tooling üìã FUTURE
- [ ] JSON/CLI communication protocol implementation per Protocols.md
- [ ] Desktop configuration and tuning application
- [ ] Advanced diagnostic data export and analysis  
- [ ] Firmware update and deployment utilities

## Phase 7: Production Readiness üìã FUTURE
- [ ] Real vehicle CAN signal mapping (replace speculative IDs)
- [ ] Physical hardware validation and sensor calibration
- [ ] Complete safety validation and stress testing
- [ ] Installation documentation and user guides
- [ ] Mobile app development for Bluetooth interface  
- [ ] Production deployment testing

## Key Design Achievements Completed

### Control Philosophy Refinement
Established comprehensive torque-following architecture:
- **3-tier priority hierarchy**: Safety ‚Üí Performance/Comfort balance with aggression mediation
- **Pure torque-following**: System follows ECU torque requests, not predetermined curves  
- **ECU cooperation strategy**: Work with ECU logic to prevent harsh interventions
- **Aggression-based scaling**: Single parameter controls all response characteristics
- **User responsibility model**: Users set limits, system provides intelligent guidance

### Documentation Architecture
- **Comprehensive technical specs**: Single source of truth for all hardware details
- **Layered documentation**: Clear reading order from Context ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Safety
- **Consistent terminology**: Eliminated confusion between control parameters and concepts
- **Safety-first organization**: Safety requirements integrated throughout all documents
- **Protocol specification**: Complete JSON/CLI interface definition

### Configuration Simplification  
- **5-parameter model**: Reduced from complex profile system to essential parameters
- **Safety ceiling distinction**: max_boost_psi as limit, not operational target
- **Single aggression control**: 0.0 (naturally aspirated) to 1.0 (maximum assistance)
- **Learned data separation**: User config independent from system learning
- **Live adjustment capability**: Safe parameter changes during operation

### Technical Innovations Specified
- **PWM synchronization strategy**: Beat frequency prevention for pneumatic control
- **Storage architecture**: Automotive power-loss resilient with wear tracking
- **Sensor fusion approach**: CAN MAP + dedicated boost gauge with auto-calibration
- **Progressive safety system**: Learning-based overboost prevention with confidence tracking
- **Closed-bias wastegate control**: Efficiency optimization while maintaining safety

## AI Working Agreements
When assisting with this project, AI must:
1. **Never drop requirements**: anything listed in the spec documents is binding until explicitly removed.  
2. **Work module-by-module**: respect API contracts, don't introduce cross-cutting hacks.  
3. **Document assumptions clearly**: mark speculative areas with `‚ö† SPECULATIVE` so humans can verify.  
4. **Preserve clarity and style**: verbose variable names, self-documenting code, proper comments for math/algorithms.  
5. **Approachability**: Never assume the reader is an expert in the math, jargon, microcontroller, physics, or theory.
6. **Fail safe in code paths**: defaults and error states must never result in uncontrolled boost.  
7. **Keep testability in mind**: unit tests must be able to run with fake data without hardware.  
8. **Surface gaps**: if required details are missing from the spec, pause and request clarification rather than guessing silently.  
9. **Respect layering**: HAL abstractions first, hardware-specific logic later.
